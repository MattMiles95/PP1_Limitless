# Limitless

Limitless is a fitness brand made up of trainers, coaches and nutritionists who work with clients to provide bespoke training programmes. Each programme can be broken down into 4 sections – Strength, Endurance, Diet and Recovery. Anyone who is interested in building their own Limitless programme can submit an application form for a free initial consultation, or attend the Limitless Gym at the address provided on the website. 

Also on the website, you can find upcoming fitness events with links to find out more about each event, as well as links to all of Limitless’ social media accounts. Limitless has partnered with other major brands in the fitness industry, and their logos are displayed in the footer of each page. Each logo also acts as a link to the respective company’s website.

## Design

### Colours
The main colour scheme for Limitless is black, white and beige – these are the base colours used in the website’s logo, headings and nav features. However, different sections have their own independent colour schemes to create a sense of segregation between the different sections and maintain  user’s attention. For each section, I have selected a colour scheme based on the colours featured in the primary image to give a sense of cohesion, with high contrast in text for accessibility.

### Typography
'Anybody' from Google Fonts is the primary font used throughout the website, with Arial as the fallback font in case the user's browser does not support Anybody. Sans-serif is the websafe choice, in case neither Anybody nor Arial load, as both of these fonts are san-serif styles. I chose Anybody as it is a minimalistic, strong looking font that I feel is suited to the Limitless brand. 

Other fonts used in the website are Impact (with 'Haettenschweiler', Arial Narrow Bold and sans-serif as fallbacks) for the Beyond the Limits heading, and ABeeZee (with Arial Narrow Bold and sans-serif as fallbacks) for the Mindful Earth heading. I chose these fonts as they are used by their respective brands, and so provide a sense of continuity between my website and the websites linked in these sections. 

### Images 
All images used were designed to inspire the user to want to engage with the activity they represent. They depict either athletes at peak fitness (intended to inspire users to want to be like these athletes) and/or teamwork between two or more people (intended to evoke in users a desire to belong to the Limitless community).

### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the very initial design of the website; however, in practice, as this was my first project, the design of the website was very dynamic in it's evolution. As such, the wireframes didn't greatly inform the final design.

### Accessibility
To ensure equal opporunity to engage amongst all users, accessibility was at the core of the design of my website:
 
* Alt text, aria-labels and semantic html are used throughout the site to aid screen readers. 
* All colour schemes used utilise contrast between background and foreground to ensure ease of readability. All background/foreground contrasts were tested using [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and recieved passing grades across the board.

### Responsiveness
Using the concept of 'mobile first design', I initially designed the website for use on smartphones and then built up it's responsiveness on larger devices from there. I utilised the principles of mobile first design for several reasons: 

* Improved User Experience - as of 2024, the majority of users access the Internet via smartphones. As such, the bulk of users will be accessing my website on a mobile device. By prioritising the mobile user experience, I can provide a faster, smoother and more engaging experience for the widest possible audience.

* Better SEO - many search engines prioritise mobile-friendly websites. Therefore, a website designed for mobile phones will have better SEO and hopefully receive more traffic.

* Faster Load Times - designing a website based on the restrictions of a mobile phone (smaller screen, slower Internet, etc.) prevents mobile users from having a bad experience and ensures a smooth, fast load time across all devices. 

All pages are designed to be responsive across an array of devices, regardless of dimensions or size. Several media queries ensure that the website runs smoothly on small, medium and large smartphones (portrait and landscape), tablets, laptops and large desktop screens. Rather than use a 'one size fits all' approach, which can lead to poor user experiences on non-prioritised devices, I have designed each media query separately so to ensure that users have a smooth and engaging experience no matter what device they use to access the website.
