# Limitless

Limitless is a fitness brand made up of trainers, coaches and nutritionists who work with clients to provide bespoke training programmes. Each programme can be broken down into 4 sections – Strength, Endurance, Diet and Recovery. Anyone who is interested in building their own Limitless programme can submit an application form for a free initial consultation, or attend the Limitless Gym at the address provided on the website. 

Also on the website, you can find upcoming fitness events with links to find out more about each event, as well as links to all of Limitless’ social media accounts. Limitless has partnered with other major brands in the fitness industry, and their logos are displayed in the footer of each page. Each logo also acts as a link to the respective company’s website.

## Design

### Colours
The main colour scheme for Limitless is black, white and beige – these are the base colours used in the website’s logo, headings and nav features. However, different sections have their own independent colour schemes to create a sense of segregation between the different sections and maintain  user’s attention. For each section, I have selected a colour scheme based on the colours featured in the primary image to give a sense of cohesion, with high contrast in text for accessibility.
