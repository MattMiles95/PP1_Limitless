# Limitless

Limitless is a fitness brand made up of trainers, coaches and nutritionists who work with clients to provide bespoke training programmes. Limitless is a brand aimed at anyone who embraces the importance of fitness in their life - whether they're just beginning their fitness journey, or they've been exercising for years. Each programme can be broken down into 4 sections – Strength, Endurance, Nutrition and Recovery. These four themes provide the building blocks for the website and feature as the focus of the homepage. 

Browsing the Limitless website, you'll notice a clear and repeated call to action: <em>"Go Further"</em>. This is ultimately the purpose of the website - to inspire users to want to "go further" with their fitness, and to use Limitless to achieve this. Anyone interested in building their own Limitless programme can submit an application form for a free consultation on the "Go Further" page, or attend the Limitless Gym at the address provided. 

Also on the website, you can find upcoming fitness events, each with their own dedicated section. External links are provided to allow the user to find out more information about each event. The purpose of the Events section is to establish a sense of community that the user will want to become a part of.

## Design

### Colours
The main colour scheme for Limitless is black, white and beige – these are the base colours used in the website’s logo, headings and nav features. However, different sections have their own independent colour schemes to create a sense of segregation between the different sections and maintain  user’s attention. For each section, I have selected a colour scheme based on the colours featured in the primary image to give a sense of cohesion, with high contrast in text for accessibility.

* Limitless:

### Typography
'Anybody' from Google Fonts is the primary font used throughout the website, with Arial as the fallback font in case the user's browser does not support Anybody. Sans-serif is the websafe choice, in case neither Anybody nor Arial load, as both of these fonts are san-serif styles. I chose Anybody as it is a minimalistic, strong looking font that I feel is suited to the Limitless brand. 

Other fonts used in the website are Impact (with 'Haettenschweiler', Arial Narrow Bold and sans-serif as fallbacks) for the Beyond the Limits heading, and ABeeZee (with Arial Narrow Bold and sans-serif as fallbacks) for the Mindful Earth heading. I chose these fonts as they are used by their respective brands, and so provide a sense of continuity between my website and the websites linked in these sections. 

### Images 
All images used were designed to inspire the user to want to engage with the activity they represent. They depict either athletes at peak fitness (intended to inspire users to want to be like these athletes) and/or teamwork between two or more people (intended to evoke in users a desire to belong to the Limitless community).

### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the very initial design of the website; however, in practice, as this was my first project, the design of the website was very dynamic in it's evolution. As such, the wireframes didn't greatly inform the final design. 

<details><summary>A sample of my initial wireframes:</summary><p align="left"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/drnx69cce/image/upload/v1712187930/wireframe-sample_vyqrv4.webp"></p></details>

### Accessibility
To ensure equal opporunity to engage amongst all users, accessibility was at the core of the design of my website:
 
* Alt text, aria-labels and semantic html are used throughout the site to aid screen readers. 
* All colour schemes used utilise contrast between background and foreground to ensure ease of readability. All background/foreground contrasts were tested using [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and recieved passing grades across the board.

<details><summary>Screenshot of Contrast Checker to demonstrate test:</summary><p align="left"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/drnx69cce/image/upload/v1712186684/contrast-checker-demo_h8oode.webp"></p></details>

### Responsiveness
Using the concept of 'mobile first design', I initially designed the website for use on smartphones and then built up it's responsiveness on larger devices from there. I utilised the principles of mobile first design for several reasons: 

* Improved User Experience - as of 2024, the majority of users access the Internet via smartphones. As such, the bulk of users will be accessing my website on a mobile device. By prioritising the mobile user experience, I can provide a faster, smoother and more engaging experience for the widest possible audience.

* Better SEO - many search engines prioritise mobile-friendly websites. Therefore, a website designed for mobile phones will have better SEO and hopefully receive more traffic.

* Faster Load Times - designing a website based on the restrictions of a mobile phone (smaller screen, slower Internet, etc.) prevents mobile users from having a bad experience and ensures a smooth, fast load time across all devices. 

All pages are designed to be responsive across an array of devices, regardless of dimensions or size. Several media queries ensure that the website runs smoothly on small, medium and large smartphones (portrait and landscape), tablets, laptops and large desktop screens. Rather than use a 'one size fits all' approach, which can lead to poor user experiences on non-prioritised devices, I have designed each media query separately so to ensure that users have a smooth and engaging experience no matter what device they use to access the website. 

<details><summary>Screenshots of Strength Section across different sized devices:</summary><p align="left"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/drnx69cce/image/upload/v1712186581/strength-samples_jf5f56.webp"></p></details>

## Features

### Homepage
![Homepage Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-hompage.webp)

The purpose of the homepage is to grab the user's attention, convey the general purpose of the website (the user should identify that Limitless is a fitness brand), and build the user's intrigue as to what Limitless has to offer. This is done with a visually engaging hero image of an athlete using battle ropes, with the heading and sub-heading displayed prominently around the focal point of the hero image. There is very little clutter at the top of the homepage, as this is the first thing the user sees. There is only the header (nav section), hero image and page headings. The heading is simply the brand name - "Limitless". The sub-heading is a call to action - "Go Further". This sub-heading doubles as a button that, when clicked, takes the user to the Go Further page, where they can submit their details and sign up for a consultation. 

Scrolling down the homepage reveals four sections - Strength, Endurance, Nutrition and Recovery. Each section offers an insight into what a full Limitless Programme contains.

### Events Page
![Events Page Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-events.webp)

The purpose of the Events page is to evoke a sense of community in the user, as well as promote specific fitness events. This is again conveyed with a hero image (depicting group activity), an engaging heading (encouraging a sense of community) and a call to action as a sub-heading (promoting the below-advertised events). 

This page is also split into four sections each with a similar yet distinctive colour scheme to make the division between sections clear. Each colour scheme is based on the respective event's own logo, to create a sense of cohesion. As well as providing short, punchy snippets of information about the events, each section has a 'Read more' button that takes users to the respective websites of each event (via a new tab).

### Go Further Page
![Go Further Page Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-go-further.webp)

"Go Further" acts as both the tagline to the Limitless brand and the primary call to action. It's imploring users to go further with their fitness, and to use Limitless to achieve that. The Go Further page is therefore where users can sign up to start their Limitless journey. Here the sub-heading from the Homepage is repeated, but this time as the main heading. This callback creates a sense of continuity, and the repetition reaffirms the brand identity. 

This page features a form that captures information about the user that is pertinent to their consultation. There are a variety of form features, including radio buttons, checkboxes, text input and dropdown menues. Key information, such as the user's email address, must be completed in order for the form to submit. Any missed/incorrectly completed sections will be highlighted to the user upon failing to submit the form.

As well as this form, a Google Maps iframe has been embedded in the page to give users an alternative way to contact Limitless staff, making it quick and easy for users to identify the location of the Limitless Gym so that they can visit it in person. 

### Form Submitted Page
![Form Submitted Page Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-form-submitted.webp)

Upon submitting their form, users are directed to a page congratulating them on taking the first step on their Limitless journey. Users are assured that a coach will contact them shortly, and offered a sneak preview at one of the workout videos offered by Limitless. This is presented in an embedded YouTube video. From here, users can watch the video or navigate their way back to the other pages.

### Favicon
![Favicon Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-favicon.webp)

The favicon is the small image that appears to the left of the webpage's title on the user's browser tab. It is important for brand identity, as well as conforming with webpage conventions and providing users with a positive experience. My favicon is a bold white 'L' against a black background. The 'L' represents 'Limitless', and the black and white colouring is inkeeping with the brand's colour scheme. It is best to choose a simple design for a favicon, as they are typcially very small and so fine details would likely be illegible and look messy. I created my favicon using Photopea, a photo editing software.

### Footer
![Footer Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-footer.webp)

The footer section is consistent across each page. It promotes the brands that Limitless is partnered with by using each of their logos. Clicking on these logos takes the user to the companies' respective websites (via a new tab).

To the bottom left of the footer is Limitless' mission statement, headed by the brand's name and tagline. The mission statement reinforces the purpose of the website and the brand's identity. 

To the bottom right of the footer is Limitless' contact information. Conventionally, the footer is where users would expect to find contact information, and so adhering to this convention provides users with a positive experience of normality. Subverting the user's expectations should only be done to enhance the user's experience - otherwise, conventions such as these should be followed. 

At the very bottom of the footer, evenly spread across the viewport, are the recognised logos for several social media platforms. Clicking these will direct the user (via a new tab) to Limitless' respective social media pages.

### Navigation Bar
![Nav Bar Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-nav-bar.webp)

The header on each page contains the Navigation Bar, with the current page indicated by a soft white glow around the text. On the homepage, there is an additional nav bar, specifically for navigating the homepage (as seen in the above screenshot). Both nav bars are designed to stick to the top of the viewport, so as the user scrolls, they will always have access to the nav bar. This provides ease of navigation around the website. If the user clicks on the page that they are already on, they are smoothly scrolled back to the top of that page. When the user hovers their cursor over a different page in the nav bar, the text for that page will begin to glow, providing the user a positive experience with visual feedback. 

### Dropdown Menu
![Dropdown Menu Screenshot 1](/assets/readme-images/features-dropdown-menu-1.webp)

![Dropdown Menu Screenshot 2](/assets/readme-images/features-dropdown-menu-2.webp)

When the viewport is too narrow to facilitate the page nav menu on the Homepage, a dropdown button will appear instead. Users can toggle this dropdown button to reveal/hide the page nav menu, now displayed in a vertical format. This adds an additional layer of responsiveness to the page, maintaining a good user experience even on particularly narrow devices.

### Links

All links feature aria-labels to indicate to users accessing the page with a screen reader where the link will take them. Any link to an external website will open in a new tab in the user's browser. Furthermore, all links to external websites utilise the "noopener" attribute to enhance the user's security when navigating to a new website.

To ensure consistency in each pages' aesthetics, the defeault text decorations for all links (blue colour, underlined, purple colour once clicked) have been removed. 

### Buttons
![Buttons Screenshot](/assets/readme-images/features-buttons.webp)

Throughout the website I have used several buttons. Each of these buttons work in the same way as the links described above. I designed each of the 'Read more' buttons using Photopea. When a user hovers their cursor over the 'Go Further' button on the Homepage, the colours of the button invert and the box shadow disappears, to provide the user with satisfying visual feedback.

### Scroll Animation
The scroll animation for the website has been designed to provide a smooth user experience. This is most evident when using an internal page link for navigation (i.e., clicking the 'recovery' page nav option on the homepage). Rather than the default animation of instantly jumping the user to that section, which can provide a jolty user experience, the page will automatically scroll the user to the desired section.

## Future Features
* Add a 'Shop' page, where users can purchase Limitless merchandise.
* Add a 'Members' page, where users can view different membership options and the related benefits and costs of each.
* Add more events, and ensure that this section is regularly updated to ensure no past events are advertised.

</details>

#### Improvements Made
I used several tactics to improve each pages' lighthouse scores, including: 
* Increasing the contrast of foreground and background colours for greater accessibility.
* Converting .png files to .webp.
* Optimising images to reduce file sizes.

#### Future Improvements
* Optimise embedded YouTube videos for increased speed and performance on mobile devices.

### Manual Testing
To ensure a positive user experience and test that the website runs smoothly across an array of browsers and devices, the website was manually tested on the following:

#### Browsers
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Mozilla Firefox
* Safari

#### Devices
* Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (412 x 750) 
* iPhone 13 (390 x 661)
* Apple iPad 8th Gen (580 x 548)
* 15.6" Portable Monitor (1280 x 551)
* 15.6" Windows Laptop (1536 x 695)

(The above viewports were calculated using [whatismyviewport.com](https://whatismyviewport.com/) on each devices' maximised browser window.)

The following features were manually tested on each of the above browsers and devices: 

* General performance
* Responsiveness
* Google Fonts
* All links (internal and external)
* Form submission
* Scroll animations
* Hover animations
* Dropdown menu/toggle (where accessible)
* Google Maps (embedded)
* YouTube video (embedded)

#### Additional Testing
* The wesbite was also extensively audited using Chrome DevTools throughout the development process.
* Once in its final stages, friends and family were invited to use the website and provide feedback on their personal user experience.
* The functionality of the form was tested by using a push method to "https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/", to confirm that the correct names and values were being captured by the form. Once tested, I reverted the method to "GET" and the action to "form-submitted.html", to give a more realistic experience of what a user might expect when signing up to a service on a website.

### Bugs and Fixes
During the development of my website, I encountered several bugs that required fixes. I have documented these below:

* Syntax errors - when carrying out W3C validator tests, several syntax errors were identified across the website files (stray curly brackets, typos, etc.). These were all fixed simply by correcting the mistakes.

* Homepage elements overflowing on screens 1340px wide and smaller - this was caused by the four homepage sections being wider than the viewport for this screensize. I fixed this by adding a flex-shrink property to all of the sections, causing them to evenly shrink to fit inside the viewport. 

* Homepage elements overflowing on screens 768px wide and larger - this was caused by the nav-menu div having too much padding, causing the element to overflow beyond the main content. This in turn caused side scroll, as well as all elements with a width of 100% to appear as though overflowing as well. I fixed this by identifying the div with the excess padding and reducing it to 0.

* Footer disappearing on homepage - this was one of the earliest bugs I encountered in my project, and was caused by the CSS rule 'background-attachment: fixed' on the hero image causing the other sections of the page to behave unexpectedly. I fixed this bug by removing the problematic CSS rule.

* Form Submitted background image not appearing on deployed site - this bug was caused by me using an absolute path for the image. I fixed this by changing to a relative path.

* Slow website performance - this was caused by having images that were too large in both scale and file size. I fixed this by optimising the images used (reducing scale and quality to reduce file size).

* Media queries cascading issue - my media query for horizontal phones (determined by a maximum screen height of 450px) was being overruled by later media queries based on screen width. I fixed this by placing the media query at the very bottom of the stylesheet.

## Local Development & Deployment

### Local Development
The website was developed using Visual Studio Code, with all local files stored in my Dropbox to provide a cloud-based backup. All live code is stored in my GitHub repository - PP1_Limitless (via routine 'git push' commands). The following VS Code extensions were used in the development of the website:
* Git
* GitHub Codespaces
* GitHub Repositories
* Live Server

### Deployment 
This site was deployed via GitHub Pages, using the following steps:
1. Open the GitHub repository - [PP1_Limitless](https://github.com/MattMiles95/PP1_Limitless).
2. Select the Settings tab.
3. Open the source-selection dropdown menu and select "Main Branch"

Upon completion of the above steps, refresh the repository homepage and scroll to the Deployments section on the right-hand side of the page. Click on "github-pages" and follow the link to the live project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
Forking the repository creates a copy of the original, allowing us to view and change the repository without affecting the original. This can be done by following the below steps:

1. Open the GitHub repository - [PP1_Limitless](https://github.com/MattMiles95/PP1_Limitless).
2. Select the "Fork" button in the top-right section of the page.

A copy of the repository should now be in your own GitHub account.

### Local Clone
Cloning the repository allows you to copy the files into your own IDE for local development. This can be done by following the below steps:

1. Open the GitHub repository - [PP1_Limitless](https://github.com/MattMiles95/PP1_Limitless).
2. Navigate the 'Code' dropdown menu and select whether you wish to clone the code using HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI.
3. Open the a Git Bash terminal in your chosen IDE and navigate your working directory to the location you wish to clone the project.
4. Use the command 'git clone' followed by the link you copied from the repository.
